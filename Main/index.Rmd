Dear students, dear visitors,

Welcome to the course site of Data Science! Data Science is a learning trajectory which is taught within the second year of the Bachelor Biomedical Sciences, Utrecht University. It includes modules on Intro R and statistics within the course ‘[*Onderzoeksmethoden*](https://uubmw.nl/onderzoeksmethoden)’.

Within the Biomedical Sciences, working with big data sets becomes more and more important. Therefore, the knowledge and skills how to handle data sets and how to perform statistical analyses is an important part of biomedical education. 

Following the different COOs (computer modules), you will install R and Rstudio and get acquainted with the basics of programming in R, after which you will use the programming to perform statistical analyses. 

Good luck!

On behalf of all involved teachers,

John Meeuwsen
